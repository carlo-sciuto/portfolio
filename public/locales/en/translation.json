My career began in 2010, where I taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and quickly became passionate about the front-end development, honing my skills in graphic design and UI creation using Photoshop and Illustrator CS4. I continued to expand my knowledge and skills, diving into the latest web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, and learning the basics of programming with PHP and MySQL database management. I have successfully built custom websites and web applications for a diverse range of clients, including professionals such as engineers and doctors, as well as businesses in industries like fitness and hospitality. With a passion for creating unique and effective solutions, I strive to avoid using third-party templates, instead opting to build everything from scratch to ensure a truly personalized experience for my clients. My love for web development has driven me to make it my career, and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow in this field."
